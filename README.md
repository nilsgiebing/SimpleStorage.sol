# SimpleStorage.sol
A simple Solidity Smart Contract which lets a user set a number and finally get in from a blockchain.

Day 1 of the #100DaysOfCode challenge.

What I've learned/created today:

Solidity
--------
Solidity is the programming language for smart contracts on various blockchain platforms. It is mostly influenced by C++, Python and JavaScript.

Scope
--------
The scope is the area from where you can access something (a variable...) or something is valid.

SimpleStorage.sol
--------
Today I've created my first Solidity-file named 'SimpleStorage.sol'. I was able to set and get a value from a JavaScript VM / Blockchain simulation.

--------------------------------------------

Day 2 of the #100DaysOfCode challenge.

What I've learned/created today:

view, pure statements
--------
The view statement lets us get and read data from a blockchain.

The pure statement ensures that it doesn't read or modify the state of a blockchain.

Struct
--------
A struct contains a group of elements with different data types. Generally, it is used to represent a record.

Array
--------
An array is a data structure that holds a list of other types.

Day 3 of the #100DaysOfCode challenge.

What I've learned/created today:

DAO
--------
A DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) is a member-owned community without centralized leadership.

Decentralized Governance
--------
There are two types that affect the protocols such as social or technical changes.
Technical changes use tokens and smart contracts to upgrade code or move funds for example.
Social changes do not require funds nor smart contracts to make changes. Partnerships are one example of a social change.

calldata
--------
Variable/data only exists temporarily while a transaction executes. Use if you don't want to modify the variable/data.

memory
--------
Variable/data only exists temporarily while a transaction executes. Use if you want to modify the variable/data.

storage
--------
Variable/data also exists outside of a function executing. Permanent variable/data that can be modified.
