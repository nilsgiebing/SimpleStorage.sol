# SimpleStorage.sol
A simple Solidity Smart Contract which lets a user set a number and finally get in from a blockchain.

Day 1 of the #100DaysOfCode challenge.

What I've learned/created today:

Solidity
--------
Solidity is the programming language for smart contracts on various blockchain platforms. It is mostly influenced by C++, Python and JavaScript.

Scope
--------
The scope is the area from where you can access something (a variable...) or something is valid.

SimpleStorage.sol
--------
Today I've created my first Solidity-file named 'SimpleStorage.sol'. I was able to set and get a value from a JavaScript VM / Blockchain simulation.
